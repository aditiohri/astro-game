                <span id="hide-me">Do you love astrology and want to learn more? Have you ever wanted to read your own <a href="https://astro.com" target="_blank">astrological birth chart</a> but didn't know where to start? This quiz is for you!</span>
                <h4 id="toggle-this">Click Here for Instructions</h4>
                <span id="info" class="slide">The symbols on the outer wheel of your birth chart, also known as glyphs,  show the twelve signs of the zodiac. To read your chart, you need to know which glyph corresponds to which sign. 
                Once you click the start button below, you will have three minutes to correctly identify the twelve glyphs for the twelve signs. I'll give you keywords that represent each sign and you'll pick from four possible answers.
                Good luck!</span>
